🛠️ Steps to Create a Standalone .exe File
✅ 1. Ensure All Dependencies Are Installed
Before creating the .exe, ensure your machine has all required libraries installed:

pip install selenium pandas openpyxl webdriver-manager pyinstaller

✅ 2. Modify the Script for WebDriver Compatibility

Since webdriver_manager downloads drivers dynamically, it may not work properly in .exe.
Instead, manually download chromedriver.exe from Chromedriver Download Page.
Place it inside the same folder as gstno_update.py.
Update your script:

cls.driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service("./chromedriver.exe"), options=chrome_options)

This ensures your .exe works without internet access on the client’s system.

✅ 3. Create .exe Using PyInstaller
Open Command Prompt (cmd) inside the script folder and run:

pyinstaller --onefile --console JDLKyc.py

--onefile → Bundles everything into a single .exe file.
--console → Opens the command prompt when running .exe (for logs).

✅ 4. Share the .exe With the Client

Send the generated gstno_update.exe file.
Also, share chromedriver.exe (keep both in the same folder).
The client only needs to double-click gstno_update.exe—no installation required! 🎉
